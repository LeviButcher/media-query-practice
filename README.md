# media-query-practice
Recreation of TNW home page. Practicing media queries. 

This project is me practicing using css media queries to be mobile friendly. Project idea is from the Odin Project.

# Note
Some display cleanup is still needed for the top articles grid. At certain screen sizes the text overflows. Need to restict sizing
or allow sizing to grow.
